## Challenges Faced

- The tech stack was new to many of us. Becoming comfortable with the game engine took time. The hectic schedule of college made it worse and a lot of us procrastinated in fullfilling our commitments.
- Exploring the basics of godot took our time and creating a basic rpg style game was the only thing we could achieve.
- Weekly meetings with the team was tricky and most of us procrastinated and wasted a lot of time. Commiting 5 hours per week was more complicatedand difficult than we thought it would be.
- At the end, A lot of dependency issues were found and fixing them took most of our time.

## Learning Points

- A new language, GDScript.
- Got comfortable with Godot game engine.
- Got Decent experience with using Notion for teams.
- Working and managing a team.
- Commiting to weekly meetings.
- Learnt Game Development.
- The importance of documenting a project frequently.
