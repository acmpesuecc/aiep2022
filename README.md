# AIEP — ACM Industrial Expereience Program

**AIEP** is **ACM Industrial Experience Program.** Every year ACM PESUECC takes on a few projects with a small team for each project, and we emulate the development pipeline used in the Industry.


This way, the club members who are partaking get to do a project this semester and experience of what it is like to work in the Industry.


This repository is to archive the Project Reports of the following projects.

# Projects

## Action RPG

An Open source Action RPG game like legend of zelda. With good soundtrack and beautiful retro artwork. A game with fun combat mechanism, quests, and exciting places to visit, an engaging story and much more.

## AllAbtBooks

Libraries in India don’t have a large, diverse collection of books. If you are an avid reader, buying books just to read it once doesn’t make sense as it is very expensive and reading e-books just isn’t the same as reading a physical book.

The Project is:
+ To create a mobile application to help users exchange books with others.
+ To create a social platform where one can elevate their love for reading by observing their friends, recommend books to their friends, host/participate in events like book club discussions

## GitHub README Generator

+ A website that generates a README file as per the user customization
+ Website consisting of elements that a user canchoose for their readme files.
+ What is it’s purpose? Saves time of GitHub users to make this on their own

## Healthify

Healthify is a mobile app which:
+ Compares medicine prices across the internet and returns the most affordable ones with OCR
+ Figure out the generic medicine name from the scanned image, and not treat it as a different name (Ex: Paracetamol and Crocin, should be treated as the same medicine)
+ Tracks your medicine requirements and reminds you to take meds
+ Alerts you to stock up before your meds run out

## Real Time Translation

A Real Time Call Translation Application, which gives a good makeover to your default calling application!

Our app works by capturing voice packets from an ongoing call and then proceeds to translate the incoming audio into the language chosen by you during/before the call and that is what you hear !

On a side note, all of this takes place in REAL TIME (with a tiny bit of delay). 
This makes communicating in different languages easier than ever!

## Zavala — FPGA Miner

Zavala is essentially an FPGA-based cryptocurrency miner. Miners play an important part in cryptocurrency mining to validate and update the blockchain ledger after every transaction taking place in that particular blockchain. Mining is mainly categorized into two modes i) GPU mining and ii) ASIC mining. A Field Programmable Gate Array is a device commonly used to simulate digital circuitry and logic. An FPGA miner basically bridges these two modes of mining, from general-purpose to application-specific since it is reprogrammable and also provides us with the ability to improve upon the hardware.
