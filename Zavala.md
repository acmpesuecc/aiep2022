# Zavala - FPGA Miner
Zavala is essentially an FPGA-based cryptocurrency miner. Miners play an important part in cryptocurrency mining to validate and update the blockchain ledger after every transaction taking place in that particular blockchain. Mining is mainly categorized into two modes i) GPU mining and ii) ASIC mining. A Field Programmable Gate Array is a device commonly used to simulate digital circuitry and logic. An FPGA miner basically bridges these two modes of mining, from general-purpose to application-specific since it is reprogrammable and also provides us with the ability to improve upon the hardware.

## Challenges Faced
+ Hectic schedules of every team member made it difficult to consistently contribute.
+ Heavily underestimated the learning curve.

## Learning Points
+ Learned to communicate in-terms of weekly meetings.
+ Got an idea to getting used to a new development process and environment.
